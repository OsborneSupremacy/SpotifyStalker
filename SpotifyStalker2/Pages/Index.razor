    <h2>What is Spotify Stalking? It sounds bad.</h2>

    <p class="lead"><i>Spotify Stalking</i> is a thing that this website helps you do. I didn't invent it. Yes, it's kind of bad.</p>
    
    <p>Basically, it's looking at someone's <b>public</b> Spotify data, which is their playlists they didn't set to private. From their playlists, we can extrapolate their favorite artists, genres, and also the <i>metrics</i> of their musical tastes, as calculated by Spotify.</p>

    <p>From those metrics, we can tell how happy the person is, how good they are, and how long they'll live, give or take 5 years.</p>
